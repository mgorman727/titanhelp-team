TitanHelp is a help desk ticket management system. 
It allows users to create, view, and track tickets for support issues. 
The project is structured with a clear separation of concerns across three layers:
- Presentation Layer (React frontend)
- Application Layer (Express backend)
- Data Access Layer (Database)
  
- application/   : Express backend handling business logic and ticket endpoints
- presentation/  : React frontend managing user interface
- data-access/   : Database layer handling persistence

- The main branch only contains merged, reviewed code.
- Each layer folder contains its own README with setup instructions.
